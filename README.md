Hello.

To compile Lucidbeaver, you need:

+ QT
+ Qmake 
+ g++
+ configured OpenGL
+ SDL with SDL_Image
+ Mxml library



To compile it to executable, you have to have properly configured libraries, listed
above. For now you can build it with 'qmake' command. It will generate Makefile.

- project is written under Ubuntu 
- CMake file will be given someday

Send me useful suggestions about this program, if You have any.

     farewell
